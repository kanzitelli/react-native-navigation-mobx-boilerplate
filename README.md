# React Native Navigation + MobX (w/ Provider) Boilerplate ðŸ‘½

A simple boilerplate based on MobX (w/ Provider) instead of Redux and [wix/react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).

##### What's inside
- Tab Based App.
- Drawer. [for iOS] It supports `.push({...})`s for the first tab through MobX: `Stores.App.rootNavigator.push({...})`. You can change `.rootNavigator` in any component. (based on [this issue](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/issues/1143))
- Simple auth flow. For example, If you are not logged in (see `Account` store), the app opens a modal with text inputs.
- `MobX Provider`. Now all components can use `@inject('App', 'Counter', ...)` for accessing stores through `const { App, Counter } = this.props;`. (based on [this comment](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/issues/187#issuecomment-265946012)).
- In a new version, structure of the project is more organized ðŸ‘Œ

##### What's in package.json
- `react '16.0.0-alpha.12'`
- `react-native '0.46.1'`
- `react-native-navigation '1.1.134'`
- `mobx '^3.1.15'`
- `mobx-persist '^0.3.3'`
- `mobx-react '^4.2.1'`
- `flow-bin '^0.47.0'`

Thanks to [@megahertz](https://github.com/megahertz) for sharing the [gist](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/issues/187#issuecomment-265946012) that shows how to create a mobx Provider which can be used with RNN.
